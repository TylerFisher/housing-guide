allison1,I think they’ve worked hard to make it more social. They try to do hall-wide social events. We have a high quality of life here.,"Tyler Daswick, Medill freshman",Allison Residential Community
allison2,"I like how nice it is, the community, all your appliances, the lounge, and I love the location as in proximity to town and a large part of campus and the sorority quads. I dislike how strict the CAs are and the administration that lives here is, and I think the dining hall is sub-par. But I like Renee, our faculty adviser; she’s a wonderful person. It could be more diverse in terms of majors and stuff.","Jessica Schapiro, Weinberg sophomore",Allison Residential Community
allison3,I don’t know the people across the hall from me.,"Dylan Rogers, Bienen freshman",Allison Residential Community
allison4,I would think this would be better for sophomores who already have set friend groups.,"Emily Honzel, Bienen freshman",Allison Residential Community
