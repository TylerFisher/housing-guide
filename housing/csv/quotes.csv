allison1,I think they’ve worked hard to make it more social. They try to do hall-wide social events. We have a high quality of life here.,"Tyler Daswick, Medill freshman",Allison Residential Community
allison2,"I like how nice it is, the community, all your appliances, the lounge, and I love the location as in proximity to town and a large part of campus and the sorority quads. I dislike how strict the CAs are and the adistration that lives here is, and I think the dining hall is sub-par. But I like Renee, our faculty adviser; she’s a wonderful person. It could be more diverse in terms of majors and stuff.","Jessica Schapiro, Weinberg sophomore",Allison Residential Community
allison3,I don’t know the people across the hall from me.,"Dylan Rogers, Bienen freshman",Allison Residential Community
allison4,I would think this would be better for sophomores who already have set friend groups.,"Emily Honzel, Bienen freshman",Allison Residential Community
allison5,"Munchies, Renee visits every floor, and dinner with a prof, where Renee invites students to eat dinner in her apartment with a professor","Evan Frohman, Weinberg freshman",Allison Residential Community
hinman1,"1835 Hinman is an overall average dorm. There are a lot of great resources that not all dorms have such as free printing, multiple kitchens, a dining hall, three lounge areas and suite-style living, but the outdated furniture and relatively small room size put somewhat of a damper on the experience."," Kyla Price, Weinberg Freshman",1835 Hinman
hinman2,"I actually really like Hinman, mostly because it's close to my [Medill] classes, has a dining hall and has the suite-style living. The dining hall is decent in the ranks of dorm food. It's also really close to Evanston, which is awesome.","Allison Tomek, Medill Freshman",1835 Hinman
hinman3,The community’s great within the suites. The community within the dorm itself isn't that great.,"Forrest Bruce, SESP Freshman",1835 Hinman
hinman4,"In addition to the suite-style housing, some of the pros of Hinman are that it has its own C-store and dining hall and being close to Evanston makes it really convenient to go to CVS or anywhere downtown. Cons would include being far away from Tech and north campus buildings that you might have many classes in if you're a science major/engineer.","Richard Han, Weinberg Freshman",1835 Hinman
hinman5,"Most of my dorm activities consist of spending time with my lovely friends, whether we're playing video games or having meals together. I also have a weekly Bible study group here.","Brandon Torres, Weinberg Freshman",1835 Hinman
