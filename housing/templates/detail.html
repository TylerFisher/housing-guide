					<h3>What residents say</h3>
					<p class="body-text">"Very clique-y. If you're not an RTVF major, you will feel left out. The sophomores are already best friends so it's hard for the freshmen to fit in."</p>
					<p class="body-text">"Most in the dorm are RTVF or journalism majors, which makes it very nice for those people, but other majors are not left out either. CRC has a lot of very cool traditions."</p>
					<p class="body-text">"This dorm should have been renovated twenty years ago. An alum came back who lived here in the 80s and said he had the same furniture."</p>
					<p class="body-text">"It's super close to all south classes, so you can roll out of bed at 8:53 and get to a 9 am class with a minute to breathe."</p>
					<p class="body-text">"Everyone here only hangs out with/parties with/talks to /sleeps with people here. It's also very nerdy and into things like video games, comic books, internet memes, etc."</p>
					<p class="body-text">"If you are fairly sarcastic, enjoy messing with people, internet memes, and don't necessarily need to party 24/7, CRC is a great dorm."</p>
					<p class="body-text">"The people are really interesting, but having such a small, tight-knit, family-like community can also mean that fights and bullshit and divisions all get blown up much larger than they need to be."</p>
					<p class="body-text">"Very social, trusting, and weird. It definitely has its own fun, unique culture."</p>
